# üöÄ Quick Start Guide - Get Running in 10 Minutes!

## ‚ö° **Super Fast Setup for Busy Students**

**Want to see this system in action RIGHT NOW?** Follow these steps and you'll have the Harvard Remote System running in under 10 minutes!

---

## üéØ **What You'll Accomplish**
By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- ‚úÖ A running server on your computer
- ‚úÖ The Android APK installed on a device/emulator
- ‚úÖ A live connection between them
- ‚úÖ Working remote commands

---

## üìã **Prerequisites Check** (2 minutes)

### **Required Software**
- [ ] **Android Studio** (any recent version)
- [ ] **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- [ ] **Git** (for cloning the project)
- [ ] An **Android device** OR **Android emulator**

### **Quick Install Check**
```bash
# Check if you have everything
node --version    # Should show v14+
git --version     # Should show git version
adb version       # Should show Android Debug Bridge
```

**Don't have something? Check [`07-DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md`](07-DEVELOPMENT_SETUP.md) for detailed installation instructions.**

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è **Step 1: Get the Code** (1 minute)

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd Remote-System-APK

# Verify you have the structure
ls -la
# You should see: APK/, SERVER/, Documents/
```

---

## üñ•Ô∏è **Step 2: Start the Server** (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to the simple server
cd SERVER/simple-server

# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Start the server
npm start
```

**You should see:**
```
üöÄ Harvard Remote System Server running on port 3000
‚úÖ Socket.IO server ready
üì± Waiting for device connections...
```

**Keep this terminal open!**

---

## üì± **Step 3: Prepare the Android App** (3 minutes)

### **Option A: Use Pre-built APK** (Faster)
```bash
# If you have a pre-built APK
cd APK
adb install app-debug.apk
```

### **Option B: Build from Source** (Slower but Educational)
```bash
# Open Android Studio
cd APK
# Open this folder in Android Studio
# Click "Build > Build APK"
# Install the generated APK
```

---

## üîß **Step 4: Configure Connection** (1 minute)

### **For Android Emulator**
The app is pre-configured to connect to `10.0.2.2:3000` (emulator's host machine).

### **For Real Android Device**
1. Find your computer's IP address:
```bash
# On Windows
ipconfig
# On Mac/Linux
ifconfig | grep inet
```

2. Update the server URL in the app or use our configuration system (see [`12-NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.md`](12-NETWORK_CONFIGURATION.md) for details).

---

## üöÄ **Step 5: Launch & Connect** (1 minute)

### **On your Android device:**
1. Open the **"Google Services"** app (that's our stealth name!)
2. The app should automatically start and connect
3. Check your server terminal - you should see:
```
üì± Device connected: [device-id]
‚úÖ Device registered successfully
```

### **Check the Connection:**
- **Android app**: Should show "Connected" status
- **Server terminal**: Should show device connection logs
- **Notification**: Minimal "Google Services" notification appears

---

## üéÆ **Step 6: Test Basic Commands** (1 minute)

### **From your server terminal, you can now test commands:**

```javascript
// The server provides a simple web interface
// Open your browser to: http://localhost:3000
// You'll see connected devices and can send test commands
```

### **Quick Test Commands:**
1. **Device Info**: Get basic device information
2. **Battery Status**: Check device battery level  
3. **Network Info**: Get WiFi/mobile connection details
4. **App List**: See installed applications

## üéâ **Success! You're Connected!**

**Congratulations!** Your Harvard Remote System is now running! Here's what you've accomplished:

### **‚úÖ What's Working:**
- Real-time connection between Android app and server
- Command processing system
- Stealth notification system
- Background service maintaining connection
- Basic remote operations

### **üîç What You Should See:**
- **Server Console**: Device connection logs and command responses
- **Android Device**: Minimal "Google Services" notification
- **Network Traffic**: Real-time Socket.IO communication

---

## üîç **Quick Troubleshooting**

### **App Won't Connect?**
```bash
# Check if server is running
curl http://localhost:3000
# Should return: "Harvard Remote System Server"
```

### **Can't Find the App?**
- Look for **"Google Services"** in your app drawer
- Check if installation was successful: `adb shell pm list packages | grep remote`

### **Commands Not Working?**
- Check server logs for error messages
- Verify network connectivity between device and server
- Ensure all required permissions are granted
