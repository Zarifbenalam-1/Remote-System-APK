## 🎯 **WHAT IS THE BEAST?**

The BEAST is an **enterprise-grade remote device management server** that enables real-time control of Android devices from Windows computers. It's like **TeamViewer for Android** but built from scratch with:

✅ **Enterprise Security** (JWT + API keys + rate limiting)  
✅ **Real-time Communication** (WebSocket-based instant control)  
✅ **Production Monitoring** (Prometheus metrics + health checks)  
✅ **Scalable Architecture** (Clustering + Redis queuing)  
✅ **Cloud Deployment** (Docker + Kubernetes + Render.com)
